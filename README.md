WeatherApp
==========

A SwiftUI-based weather tracker application that allows users to search for cities, view weather information, and persist their favorite city across app launches. Built with a focus on clean architecture, this application demonstrates the use of MVVM principles and integrates data from WeatherAPI.com.
